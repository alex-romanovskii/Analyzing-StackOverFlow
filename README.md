# Analyzing StackOverFlow open questionnaires

This project was made as part of the course 'The Art of Analyzing Big Data'  
For our project, we used the StackOverFlow open questionnaires. Questionnaires are presented in the form of csv-files for each year separately from 2011 to 2019. Each year, the questionnaire is modified: some questions are added or removed, questions and possible answers also undergo changes.
Link for questionnaires: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

The aim of the project is to analyze the questionnaires for all the years and find something interesting. In order to proceed to the analysis, it is necessary to carry out pre-processing, namely, to bring the questionnaires for all years (with different questions and different answer options) to to general view.

The project includes:
  - Main file: project.ipynb
